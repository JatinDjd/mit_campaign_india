## CSS Structure

- `common.css`: Holds common styling elements used across the entire application.
- `navbar.css`: Contains styles for the navigation bar.
- `footer.css`: Contains styles for the footer section.
- `specific-page.css`: A specific CSS file for each distinct page (e.g., `web-design.css`) to keep styles separate and organized. (css file must be named after the page it is going to be included.)

## Media Files

We avoid cluttering the repository with media files. Instead, use live URLs to include images. Developers can upload images to `upload.masterinfotech.com` and acquire the media URL for integration into the project.

## Template Folder

The `template` folder is vital for maintaining consistency and reducing redundant code. Please refrain from altering its contents. Use it as a reference or copy templates when creating new elements like headers, footers, forms, and validation codes.

## Contributing

We encourage contributions from the developer community. To contribute:

1. Test before on local before comming or pushing the code to the repository.
2. Always take git pull before starting the work on this project and before pushing the code.
3. Always push code after section is complete do not wait for the END OF THE DAY.

Please ensure your contributions adhere to our coding standards and practices.

## Key Points for Frontend Devs

1. Do not @import fonts in css files. Use <link> tags.
